Today (2026/02/27) focus on: **Storytelling & Anecdotes** — how natives tell short stories and personal anecdotes in conversation: setting the scene, building tension, and landing a punchline or conclusion (e.g. 'So there I was…', 'Long story short…', 'You'll never guess what happened…', 'And then it hit me…'). Provide: (1) a short explanation of the skill, (2) 10 example sentences contrasting textbook vs native phrasing, (3) a 5-minute speaking drill, (4) 3 common mistakes to avoid, (5) a fun challenge sentence to try out loud. End by suggesting the NEXT topic that logically follows, formatted as a JSON block: {\"next_topic\": \"...\", \"next_skill_focus\": [\"...\"], \"next_prompt\": \"...\"}."
