Today (2026/02/26) focus on: **Expressing opinions naturally** — how natives hedge, agree, disagree, and give opinions without sounding formal (e.g. 'I'd say…', 'Honestly…', 'If you ask me…', 'I'm not so sure about that'). Provide: (1) a short explanation of the skill, (2) 10 example sentences contrasting textbook vs native phrasing, (3) a 5-minute speaking drill, (4) 3 common mistakes to avoid, (5) a fun challenge sentence to try out loud. End by suggesting the NEXT topic that logically follows, formatted as a JSON block: {\"next_topic\": \"...\", \"next_skill_focus\": [\"...\"], \"next_prompt\": \"...\"}."
